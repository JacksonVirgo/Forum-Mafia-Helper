1. Rework the way the data scraping works.
    - Scrape the very first page of the thread to get the settings.
    - If the settings are invalid or don't exist, return that to the user.
    - Upon invalid settings, prompt one of the following actions
        - Abandon Process.
        - Create a settings spoiler with a new form.
        - Return a list of all votes in the thread in order.
    - If a post url is inputted, convert that to a thread URL from that post.

2. Split the logic in the scraping to avoid repitition and
    allow easy scaling.
